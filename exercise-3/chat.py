Chitchat
Now you're going to leave the simple EchoBot behind and create a bot which can answer simple questions such as "What's your name?" and "What's today's weather?"

You'll use a dictionary with these questions as keys and the correct responses as values.

This means the bot will only respond correctly if the message matches exactly, which is a big limitation. In later exercises you will create much more robust solutions.

The send_message() function has already been defined for you, as well as the bot_template and user_template variables.

# Define variables
name = "Greg"
weather = "cloudy"

# Define a dictionary with the predefined responses
responses = {
  "what's your name?": "my name is {0}".format(name),
  "what's today's weather?": "the weather is {0}".format(weather),
  "default": "default message"
}

# Return the matching response if there is one, default otherwise
def respond(message):
    # Check if the message is in the responses
    if message in responses:
        # Return the matching message
        bot_message = responses[message]
    else:
        # Return the "default" message
        bot_message = responses["default"]
